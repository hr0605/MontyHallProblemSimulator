    <h1>Monty Hall Problem Simulation</h1>
    <p>
        Description: The Monty Hall problem is a famous probability puzzle named after the "Let's Make a Deal" game show host Monty Hall. 
        The scenario involves a contestant who is presented with three doors: behind one is a car and behind the other two are goats. 
        The contestant chooses one of the doors in an attempt to find the car. 
        Then, the host, who knows what is behind each door, opens one of the other two doors to reveal a goat. 
        The contestant is asked whether they would like to stick with their original choice or switch to the remaining unopened door. 
    </p>
        
    <p>
        Below is a simulation of the problem. 
        Play to see whether there is a higher chance of winning when sticking to the original choice or when switching doors.
